# Image-Classification
Imafe classification with CIFAR10
Implementation of basic image classifiers on the CIFAR-10 dataset using simple linear algebra operations and the numpy, matplotlib, and pickle packages. Specifically, we build nearest mean and nearest neighbor classifiers and evaluate their performance. Then, we create a linear classifier using the least squares method to optimize the objective cost function, and we further explore the effect of the learning rate.
